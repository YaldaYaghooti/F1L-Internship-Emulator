# Key Scientific Question (KSQ)

Using available scRNA-seq data from cancer cell lines, how would you explore the use of the following FDA-approved antibody therapies in additional cancers?

Trastuzumab: Targets HER2 and is used in the treatment of HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers.

Bevacizumab: Targets VEGF and is used for a variety of cancers, including colorectal, lung, glioblastoma, breast, liver, and kidney cancer.

# My Understanding of the KSQ

How can we use scRNA-seq data to identify cell lines from cancer types other than ones mentioned above that are (in a way) similar to these cancer types?

# Unclear elements of the KSQ

1) Do we assume that any cell line with the mentioned cancer types with the mentioned condition (e.g., HER2-positive) respond to these medications?
2) Is this a classification task (stating in the end what other cancer types will probably respond to these medications) or should we rank cancer types based on any score we obtain?
3) Do we only have access to scRNA-seq data or could we use other data types such as genetic mutations present in the cell lines?
